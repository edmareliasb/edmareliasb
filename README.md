### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Software Developersince 2007, working with back-end techs like Java, Spring, Quarkus, Microservices, Docker and K8S.

Lastly, I am working with Python for creating automation scripts for daily and repetitive tasks.

At last but not least, I have strong teamwork skills. I really fond work with teams, stay connect with people, exchanging experiences, and abilities, and learning from each other.
